How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It quickly brought up the differences between the 2 files so that I the user would 
not have to waste time, inefficiently looking for a mistake.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I can keep track of changes made, and changes of other people

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Better to do it manually, more control that way. Plus, auto saves could save in the middle of a line, creating confusion.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Space issue?

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log shows all commits made, and then diff to shows the any changes made

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I can always go back and make the necessary changes through git checkout

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Move documents, rename them, open apps, compare instances etc
